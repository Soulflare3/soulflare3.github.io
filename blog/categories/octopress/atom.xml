    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So far I&rsquo;ve made quite a lot of progress with the Octopress/Jekyll migration from Ghost. I had to swap out some tags from markdown to liquid (such as image tags) but I like the ease of adding media. Video for example is a lot easier to add to my posts, because Ruby handles the insertion of the necessary tags.</p>

<p>The theme I&rsquo;m using at the moment is called <a href="https://tommy351.github.io/Octopress-Theme-Slash/">Slash</a>. I like it a lot, but it&rsquo;s a bit too bright for me, so I think I&rsquo;ll tinker with it and make it darker.</p>

<p>I still like Octopress/Jekyll, though I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to use Jekyll plugins. Supposedly Jekyll has quite a few, but every time I put a gem in my <code>_config.yml</code> <code>rake</code> generates errors (from plugin manager). I&rsquo;m still new to this so it may be a little while before I actually look into the problem, but for now I&rsquo;m fine with doing stuff manually. It&rsquo;s not too bad, because I never imported my ancient blogs into Ghost, so the posts only go back a few months anyway. I did have to manually add tags/categories to all of the posts, but <a href="http://json2table.com">this JSON->table parser</a> helped me out a lot.</p>

<p>One thing I would really like to get working is Pingbacks. So far I&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://webmention.io">WebMention.io</a> which I&rsquo;ll probably end up going with anyway, because Jekyll plugins don&rsquo;t work at the moment&hellip; I still absolutely love that I can preview my entire site offline before pushing changes. <img class='emoji' title='+1' alt='+1' src='https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/+1.png' height='20' width='20' align='absmiddle' ></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man this was time consuming. I&rsquo;ve been working on this for the last 7 and hours or so. It&rsquo;s still not &ldquo;done&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s working! In all honesty, this would&rsquo;ve been a lot smoother had I not already had an existing Github Pages repo. I should&rsquo;ve just nuked the entire repository and octopress installation hours ago, started over, everything would&rsquo;ve just worked. When I installed Octopress, it tried to migrate the existing repo, which was another nightmare altogether because of the exisitng master branch. When I eventually fixed that by deleting everything in master, cloning the branch and setting the cloned branch as default, then deleting the master branch. Then when I ran Octopress it was able to create its own master branch and all was right with that portion of the site.</p>

<p>After that I spent a long time trying to get ruby/jekyll to generate the pages. Trying to debug errors completely unrelated to my problem was where I spent a majority of my time. I know <em>nothing</em> about Ruby, and the only thing I know really about Jekyll is that it can use Markdown and Github Pages uses it by default, so this was a very terrible few hours. I ended up figuring out that all of the problems were related to <code>_config.yml</code>. Specifially because the old and new configs became merged into a hideous mutant config that was breaking everything. The only reason I figured it out was because I noticed Jekyll was trying to copy the files to <code>_sites</code> and Octopress wanted them to go in <code>Public</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll take some time to get used to Jekyll/Octopress, but it already feels quite powerful. I had been poking around <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/">Aaron Gustafson&rsquo;s site</a> when I came across <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-grand-experiment/">this post</a>, which got me interested in the idea, along with the fact that Ghost has been pretty annoying and bare as of late. In order to even update the software I had to take everything offline, nuke the software, and hope the upgrade goes well. To edit any parts of the website theme, you had to make your changes and stop/start cycle the software EVERY time just to see the change. I finally had enough of it and decided I may as well start using Github. There&rsquo;s still some setup to do, and I have to go back and manually categorize all of the posts (the ghost>>jekyll exporter didn&rsquo;t grab them) but so far I&rsquo;m liking Octopress now that everything is actually working.</p>

<p>I also like that I can easily spin up a temporary copy of my site whilst editing, and see changes in realtime before making anything live. Ghost had a preview function, but it only worked for one post or page. Jekyll lets you preview the <em>entire</em> site and all of the changes. Very nice. Also moving from databases to static files is going pretty well, and has a very noticable speed increase.</p>
