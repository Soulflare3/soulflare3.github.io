    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So far I&rsquo;ve made quite a lot of progress with the Octopress/Jekyll migration from Ghost. I had to swap out some tags from markdown to liquid (such as image tags) but I like the ease of adding media. Video for example is a lot easier to add to my posts, because Ruby handles the insertion of the necessary tags.</p>

<p>The theme I&rsquo;m using at the moment is called <a href="https://tommy351.github.io/Octopress-Theme-Slash/">Slash</a>. I like it a lot, but it&rsquo;s a bit too bright for me, so I think I&rsquo;ll tinker with it and make it darker.</p>

<p>I still like Octopress/Jekyll, though I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to use plugins. Supposedly Jekyll has quite a few, but every time I put a gem in my <code>_config.yml</code> <code>rake</code> generates errors (from plugin manager). I&rsquo;m still new to this so it may be a little while before I actually look into the problem, but for now I&rsquo;m fine with doing stuff manually. It&rsquo;s not too bad, because I never imported my ancient blogs into Ghost, so the posts only go back a few months anyway. I did have to manually add tags/categories to all of the posts, but <a href="http://json2table.com">this JSON->table parser</a> helped me out a lot.</p>

<p>One thing I would really like to get working is Pingbacks. So far I&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://webmention.io">WebMention.io</a> which I&rsquo;ll probably end up going with anyway, because Jekyll plugins don&rsquo;t work at the moment&hellip; I still absolutely love that I can preview my entire site offline before pushing changes. Jekyll++</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Things may be a tad wonky around here for a bit. I&rsquo;m working on changing the theme a bit. I&rsquo;ve already added Disqus integration (which isn&rsquo;t perfect) but the basics for comments are there now. I want to add a proper menu system, maybe pages, tag cloud, etc. This theme doesn&rsquo;t include any of that by default, so I&rsquo;ll have to refer to the Ghost documentation for editing it manually&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It appears Ghost works very well on mobile devices out-of-the-box, which is a very nice feature.</p>

<p>Well it doesn&rsquo;t quite work as well as I&rsquo;d hoped. In terms of the blog itself it works fine, however if you have any secondary links or pages, there is no way to access them from what I can tell so far. Maybe there is a feature I need to change or theme edit I need to make.</p>

<p>Looks like the issue was specific to the particular theme. I may go back and edit it eventually but this one seems to be working fine.</p>

<p>Testing on my LG G3 using Chrome 44.0.2403.133.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to try Ghost ever since the project went live, yet I was never able to get it running. Frankly I&rsquo;ve never been able to get anything from NodeJS running, so I&rsquo;ve always hated the platform. I decided to give it another shot and after some tinkering was able to get it to run! \o/</p>

<p>Not sure how often I&rsquo;ll use it, but I love how fast, simple, and easy to use it is. Getting it <em>running</em> is not simple, but using it is. Also I need to learn Markdown by the looks of it&hellip; I know very little.</p>
