So having just finished Person of Interest season 4, I thought it would be a good idea to update my SideReel account. SideReel is a nice site that I've neglected use of for quite some time, even though I've had an account for a little over 4 years now. I'm just learning today how unfortunate that is. As I went to transfer my tracking progress from Netflix via my list, very quickly I found out that shows I was previously watching were no longer available to stream, and were removed completely from my list.

The most notable show I can think of that this affected for me would be 24, because I know I was fairly far into it when I stopped watching it. Now it's not on Netflix, so finding where I stopped will be a bit of a challenge.

Unfortunately I don't even know what shows *were* on the list, because Netflix silently removes them. Almost as bad as YouTube deleting videos. YouTube at least keeps the record there, so you can see that *something* was deleted. They aren't helping anyone though, because YouTube doesn't tell you *what* was deleted, only that it's gone now. They don't even save the title of the video, so you have no idea what it was. RIP playlists from 3 years ago.

I guess now I should try to remember to keep my tracking up-to-date, lest I lose more progress without even knowing it's gone...
