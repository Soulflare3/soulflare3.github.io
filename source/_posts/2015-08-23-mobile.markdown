It appears Ghost works very well on mobile devices out-of-the-box, which is a very nice feature.

Well it doesn't quite work as well as I'd hoped. In terms of the blog itself it works fine, however if you have any secondary links or pages, there is no way to access them from what I can tell so far. Maybe there is a feature I need to change or theme edit I need to make.

Looks like the issue was specific to the particular theme. I may go back and edit it eventually but this one seems to be working fine.

Testing on my LG G3 using Chrome 44.0.2403.133.
