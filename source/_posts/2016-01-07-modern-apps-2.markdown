So I wanted to post feedback about the driver mishap, and apparently there's an app called Windows Feedback. That's great and really helpful, except it doesn't load. It just sits on the title/splash screen forever. Then I found out that there's an app called Insider Hub and figured that would be a better place to try, since Feedback wasn't working. Nope, same problem.

Then I tried to uninstall it using my start menu, and this happened:

Funniest thing is that dialog didn't do anything. Both buttons just close the dialog. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling from the "Windows Optional Features" thing in Settings, and now the app won't even open anymore. Before it would at least open and show me a splash screen. Now it literally does nothing.

Yay Windows \o/
