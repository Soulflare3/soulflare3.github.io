Things may be a tad wonky around here for a bit. I'm working on changing the theme a bit. I've already added Disqus integration (which isn't perfect) but the basics for comments are there now. I want to add a proper menu system, maybe pages, tag cloud, etc. This theme doesn't include any of that by default, so I'll have to refer to the Ghost documentation for editing it manually...
