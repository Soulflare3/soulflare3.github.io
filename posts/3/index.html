  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it turns out that landing isn&rsquo;t as simple as dropping your gear and getting the ship onto the pad. There&rsquo;s even more to it than speed, proximity, and alignment to the pad. You <strong>also</strong> have to align a certain angle towards the station in order to dock, which I find very strange considering most stations will rotate your ship and the landing platform before pulling it into the bay. This is extremely frustrating to figure out when you are nearly empty on fuel after running from multiple pirates in a vessel equipped to attack space rocks, not space ships.</p>

<p>All things considered however, I love the experience. Having to shut down systems to conserve fuel while waiting for clearance to dock. Sitting completely still in a station&rsquo;s mass lock while observing dogfights at the station, hoping they don&rsquo;t try to pull you into the combat. The heart-racing experience of running from two pirates while you are low on fuel, that only caught you in interdiction because you were trying <strong>not</strong> to overshoot the station <em>again</em>.</p>

<p>I love this game</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To clarify now, I am <strong>NOT</strong> having audio problems with Elite: Dangerous. I <em>was</em> having crashes in the main menu, but haven&rsquo;t seen one in a while (though I also haven&rsquo;t spent much time there anymore, after setting up my settings). I think those crashes may have been related to the graphics driver I was on, so I upgraded to the latest NVIDIA driver (359.00 64-bit).</p>

<p>I picked up Elite: Dangerous and started playing it with a friend. The deeper I go into it, the more I find that it&rsquo;s similar to EVE Online (which is not a bad thing). I rather much enjoy the similarities, because I&rsquo;m able to pick up the game a lot faster. They are both amazingly beautiful and largely complex games. My friend suggested Netflix for longer runs, which I agreed was a good idea. However, the end setup was not what I expected.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m down to one monitor, because the TV that I was using decided to quit on me, and the parts to replace the old thing cost more than the TV is worth, especially since I&rsquo;ve already revived it once. So for now that TV is sitting in pieces and I&rsquo;m on a 5:4 until I can get a replacement.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve set a laptop to my right (where my old monitor used to be) and I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35460">Microsoft Garage Mouse Without Borders</a> to control both PCs with one keyboard and one mouse. Very nice utility (when it works). It&rsquo;s apparently supposed to synchronize clipboards, but that feature never works for me. To replace that feature, I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net">Ditto Clipboard Manager</a> which can send and receive clipboard objects between multiple PCs.</p>

<p>Previously I had been using a Lenovo R61e for basic web browsing and YouTube streaming, which was working very well. Unfortunately when streaming Netflix it is prone to lock-ups and stuttering, primarily due to the single core Intel Celeron processor that the machine sports. So I brought out my Lenovo W520 (which I loathe, I may write about that later) since that has a nice quad-core Intel i7 that can multitask fairly well.</p>

<p>Initially I was playing audio through it&rsquo;s external speakers, but this is inconvenient and makes a lot of noise (especially if others are trying to sleep). To solve this I was trying to use a simple RemAud client/server between my PCs, while using <a href="http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm">Virtual Audio Cable</a> to redirect audio. This same exact setup worked wonderfully on the R61e, but for some reason I can&rsquo;t get it to work at all on the W520. It has a lot of problems switching audio devices and then refuses to play back. Even when I got those working, RemAud kept erroring and refusing to send audio. After about 10-15 minutes playing with audio device settings, I was not able to get the problem resolved. About this same time, I remembered I had a 3.5mm cable sitting on my desk (giving me a huge &ldquo;<strong>DUH</strong>&rdquo; moment).</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an 100% simple fix, but it was pretty close. Hooking one end to the laptop&rsquo;s audio jack (it only has 1 combined mic/phone jack <em>eww</em>) and the other end to my desktop&rsquo;s mic input, I simply opened VAC on my desktop and redirected the front panel mic&rsquo;s input to my G930&rsquo;s output. The connection worked fine, but the audio quality was complete garbage. I swapped it to my rear onboard sound card, and the quality immediately changed (for the better). So now I have a secondary PC hooked up with MWB, a processor powerful enough to multitask, and clear audio redirection. I&rsquo;ve been running some tests via YouTube music videos for a while now and the audio quality is outstanding.</p>

<p>3.5mm cables are cheap and simple, but the job they do is incredible. I bought this one probably 8 years ago or so, and I use it all the time. You can pick up similar cables on Amazon for <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ta0ltG">less than $5.00</a>. I&rsquo;ll probably pick up a few more just to have some around. In the meantime, back to exploring the universe.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining my adventures. I&rsquo;m probably going to be trying out <a href="http://www.voiceattack.com">Voice Attack</a> and seeing how well it works with E:D. A lot of people seem to like it. I also need to pick up a flight stick or two, because MAN is it hard to fly with a controller and/or a keyboard &amp; mouse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It appears Ghost works very well on mobile devices out-of-the-box, which is a very nice feature.</p>

<p>Well it doesn&rsquo;t quite work as well as I&rsquo;d hoped. In terms of the blog itself it works fine, however if you have any secondary links or pages, there is no way to access them from what I can tell so far. Maybe there is a feature I need to change or theme edit I need to make.</p>

<p>Looks like the issue was specific to the particular theme. I may go back and edit it eventually but this one seems to be working fine.</p>

<p>Testing on my LG G3 using Chrome 44.0.2403.133.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to try Ghost ever since the project went live, yet I was never able to get it running. Frankly I&rsquo;ve never been able to get anything from NodeJS running, so I&rsquo;ve always hated the platform. I decided to give it another shot and after some tinkering was able to get it to run! \o/</p>

<p>Not sure how often I&rsquo;ll use it, but I love how fast, simple, and easy to use it is. Getting it <em>running</em> is not simple, but using it is. Also I need to learn Markdown by the looks of it&hellip; I know very little.</p>
